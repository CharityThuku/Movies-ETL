# Movies-ETL
## Overview of the Project 
- The overview of this project was to use ETL to extract wikipedia and kaggle data, transform it into clean and readable data, and finally load it into a database such as SQL. After extracting large data from these two websites, we cleaned it go get data on movies and how they are rated. This is needed in order to complete a concise analysis that isn't full of outliers. Loading the data onto a database helps us visualize the clean data.

## Purpose
- ETL is a data integration process that allows us to pull data from multiple sources and transform it into one dataset. Learning to do so is a lucrative skill to learn  it utilizes alot data analysis using Python, Pandas, SQL as well.

## Results 
### Extract
- Learn how to pull data from large files and create DataFrames.

### Transform
- Clean the data by removing null values, redudant data and outlying data. Format the data into layman's terms.

### Load
- Load the data into SQL to portray clear and concise data.

## Summary 
- ETL allows us to transform complex data to simple understandable data.
